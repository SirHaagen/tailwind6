# Tailwind exercise customizing styles and using @apply

You can customize a whole class to include a bunch of attributes, like so (in the input style.css):

```css
/* main button */
.btn-main{
  @apply bg-darkblue-200 text-white font-bold px-6 py-2 m-4 rounded-x20;
}
```

And then you include the customized class into your element:
```html
<button class="btn-main">Click me</button>
```

I am an active student learning CSS, JS, React, Sass, Tailwind CSS and many other stuffs. Looking for a challenging job opportunity
